# BinaryAdder
A module whose main method can add any two binary numbers and print them nicely to the screen. It is bootstrapped from only the and, or, and not gates typically available in assemblers. I define both an xor gate and then a bit of a binary adder. The main method calls nBits which creates a system of n bits feeding digits of a and b into it.
